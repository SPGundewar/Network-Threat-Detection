Setup Instruction:<br/>
1) Clone this repository<br/>
2) Download and save the data folder from the provided Google Drive (This has preprocessed data and AutoEncoder Model which you can directly load and run)<br/>
3) Update username and keys of Kaggle and run the Preprocessing.ipynb (Use jupyter notebook to run this project)<br/>
4) Run the decision tree and random forest models from Decision_Tree_RandomForest.ipynb<br/>
5) Run KNN model from KNN.ipynb<br/>
6) Run AutoEncoder_and_RandomForest.ipynb (To save time you can directly run the load previously saved model cell)<br/>
