# 🚨 **Network Threat Detection as a Multi-Class Classifier Based on Feature Relevance** 🚨

## 🔗 **Overview**
In today's hyper-connected world, **network security** is more critical than ever. This project delivers a **robust multi-class classifier** designed to detect and classify network threats efficiently. Using advanced **Machine Learning techniques**, we analyze network traffic to identify anomalies and prevent potential intrusions.
